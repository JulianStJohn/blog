I can't find my postmodernism essays. I dropped printed copies of them in the English papers submission drop-slot of the John Medley building, Melbourne University  thirty years ago to the month, so it's pretty understandable that they got lost in the meantime. Still, for a discipline that makes us aware of the futility of the quest to recover the _logos_, the _word_, it does rather tickle the irony-bone.

Unrecoverable. That's it. That's the word. I'll explain myself later, but that is the word. Unrecoverable. That's the bit I'm trying to work out at the moment. Because it seems as though we're going full circle. 

Well, in a pique of nostalgia on my lost papers feels like as good a place as any to coin a blog.
